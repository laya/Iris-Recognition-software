"At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players "
"take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six "
"houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this "
"house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise "
"from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not "
"distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That "
"is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is "
"skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if "
"the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to "
"two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the "
"player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If "
"the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's "
"house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a "
"move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and "
"the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the "
"opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an "
"opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a "
"move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses "
"are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent "
"seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in "
"his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia &lt;http://en."
