This folder contains resources for the photohunter activity.

To add a new resource, follow the naming convention:
boardX_Y[a|b].png
With:
 X = Level
 Y = Sublevel
 a = Left picture
 b = Right picture

Images can only be in PNG format because it is lossless. GCompris
detects the differences automatically.
