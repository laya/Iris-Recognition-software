	<_manual>A set of blank cards is shown. Each card has a picture on the other side, and each picture card has a twin exactly the same. Click on a card to see its hidden picture, and try to match the twins. You can only turn over two cards at once, so you need to remember where a picture is, while you look for its twin. When you turn over the twins, they both disappear.</_manual>
