These are the instructions to build GCompris on MacOSX.

Requirements:
MacOSX 10.4 or above.

First, create your compilation environment following the instructions here:
http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/

Configure step:
  cd macosx
  ./configure_mac.sh

At this point, you will have missing dependencies that you must download
and install manually following the rules defined by gtk-osx.

Compilation step:
  make

Bundle step:
  make install
  ./createBundle.sh

The resulting file is GCompris.dmg
